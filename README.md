Overview
In this project, I developed a Java program to implement a "Guess the Number" game with various difficulty levels and an option for one-guess mode. The game generates a random number within a specified range, and the player must guess the number within a limited number of attempts. Feedback is provided for guesses in modes with multiple attempts.

My purpose in writing this software was to deepen my understanding of the Java language syntax, particularly in implementing user interaction, random number generation, conditional statements, and loops. Through this project, I aimed to reinforce my knowledge of Java fundamentals and improve my problem-solving skills.

Development Environment
For this project, I used the following tools:

Java Development Kit (JDK): I installed the latest version of JDK from Oracle to compile and run Java code.
IntelliJ IDEA: I utilized IntelliJ IDEA, a powerful integrated development environment, for writing, debugging, and managing my Java code efficiently.
The programming language used for this project is Java. Additionally, I made use of the java.util.Scanner class for user input and the java.util.Random class for generating random numbers.

Useful Websites
During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful:

Oracle Java Documentation: The official documentation provided comprehensive information about Java language features, standard libraries, and best practices.
GeeksforGeeks Java Tutorials: GeeksforGeeks provided various Java tutorials and articles covering a wide range of topics, which helped me understand specific concepts and solve implementation challenges effectively.
Future Work
In future iterations of this project, I plan to:

Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive user experience.
Add additional gameplay features such as score tracking and difficulty customization.
Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability by applying design patterns and best coding practices.
